            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">When we hear "healthy diet" everyone's mind always gets a idea of quieting junkfood, having only green meals and boiled food. In simple words we can put it as stoping yourself from having your favourite food. Quiting junkfood completely will only make you to go back to your old lazy self after sometime. So along with healthy diet give yourself some reward with your favourite food once a week, to keep yourself keep going. Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. However, increased production of processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns. People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains. So, plan your diet accordingly with well balanced nutrition.</p>
